# EmilyIsAwayClone
A project independent of the interface in Emily Is Away but doing the same things.

# Why such a project?
I was bored and I was looking for project ideas. I learned the Emily Is Away game and started doing the same to improve myself and to relieve my boredom.

# Why is your code so chaotic, disorganized and poorly written?
While I am developing all my games, I develop the games with the algorithm that comes to my mind at that moment. In other words, I do not develop the game by thinking for a long time and developing an algorithm. Therefore It's bad and erratic .

# Will you continue to develop this project?
Yes, i'm developing game a bit slow, but I will improve the game until I get it exactly the same. Maybe I'll try to make the interface the same.

Important : Currently, there are no situations such as Buddy List, Personal Info and Typing, Deleting. I developed the current project in 2 hours. Therefore, I will bring updates as soon as possible.
